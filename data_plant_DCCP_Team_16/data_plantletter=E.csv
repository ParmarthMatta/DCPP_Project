561,Euphorbia peplus,Euphorbiaceae,,,latex,"This species is one of a number of plants in the Euphorbiaceae family that has attracted attention as a home remedy for skin cancer particularly basal cell carcinomas The latex causes irritation of the skin eyes and mucous membranes Due to the toxicity of the latex it is advised to use the plant topically onlybr
Several of the active compounds in this plant are good candidates to be developed into anticancer drugs considering the promising pharmacological studies and clinical trials results As the active compounds are complex molecules they have not yet been chemically produced and can only be obtained directly from the plant More research into largescale production and mechanisation of cultivation and latex extraction is neededbr
The latex yields mostly diterpenes of the jatrophane pepluane and ingenane types Jatrophane and pepluane diterpenes are noninflammatory whereas ingenane diterpenes are responsible for the irritant and tumourpromoting properties of the latexbr
Of the pepluane esters pepluanone showed significant antiinflammatory activity in vivobr
The most active compound is a hydrophobic diterpene ester ingenol 3angelate PEP005 an irritant compound which possesses topical antitumour activity against human cancer cell lines It has given more than 90 complete responses on different skin cancers in a Phase II clinical trial and has emerged as a potential new topical antiskin cancer PEP005 also has potent antileukaemic effects and a powerful inhibitory activity against a wide range of other tumours tested including breast cancer cellsbr
Several diterpenes exhibited a pronounced or moderate antiherpes virusbr

The variety of irritant compounds present in high concentrations is reflected by the irritant activity of the latex which is more than 30 times stronger in Euphorbia poissonii latex ID50  01 μg  5 μl than in the latex of eg Euphorbia unispina although after 24 hours both activities have almost the same value The isolated aromatic esters of the daphnane type are more potent irritants in mouse ear tests than the aromatic tigliane esters especially resiniferatoxin ID50  000021 nMol  5 μg and tinyatoxin ID50  00012 nMol  5 μg Of the 6 isolated aromatic tigliane esters the highly irritant 12deoxyphorbol13Ophenylacetate20Oacetate ID50  0075 nMol  5 μg is the major compound candletoxin A candletoxin B and DPP  12deoxyphorbol 13phenylacetate are also strongly irritant The irritant activity of resiniferatoxin and tinyatoxin is rapid It reaches a maximum within 4 hours and then fades to inactivity after 24 hoursbr
Resiniferatoxin and tinyatoxin are highly toxic as they bind to pain receptors in the same way as capsaicin but much more powerfully They stimulate the neurons to fire repeatedly until the neuron dies causing searing pain and sending the victim into severe anaphylactic shock Resiniferatoxin is used in the treatment of incontinence associated with an overactive bladder It also has antifeedant and analgesic properties Efforts have been made to synthesize this compound In laboratory tests DPP induced the expression of HIV1 in latently infected T cells and rendered them sensitive to killing by an immunotoxin DPP is 20 to 40fold more potent than the related phorbol ester prostratin and the combination of high potency and antitumour promoting activity makes DPP an attractive candidate for therapy of HIV1 infectionbr
During further phytochemical studies on the latex derivatives of 19hydroxyingol were isolated These compounds showed cytotoxic activities against 6 human solid tumour cell lines lung carcinoma breast carcinoma colon adrenocarcinoma kidney carcinoma prostate adenocarcinoma and pancreatic carcinoma Moreover most of the 12deoxyphorbol ester derivatives showed selective cytotoxicity for the human kidney carcinoma cell line with potencies for one compound exceeding those of the anticancer drug adriamycin by 10000 timesbr
