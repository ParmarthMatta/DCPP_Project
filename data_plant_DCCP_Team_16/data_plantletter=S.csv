The most important active compounds in the root are a range of plant steroids and saponins other compounds present include flavonoidsbr
The saponins have been shown to facilitate the bodys absorption of other drugs and phytochemicals which accounts for its history of use in herbal formulas as an agent for bioavailability and to enhancement the power and effect of other herbsbr
Clinical research has validated the traditional use of sarsaparilla for skin conditions such as psoriasis eczema acne and leprosy In one clinical study with 92 patients it was reported that use of the root improved psoriasis lesions in 62 of cases and completely cleared lesions in 18 of cases The roots blood cleansing properties are believed to be largely responsible for this and in particular the steroid sarsaponin which has been shown to remove endotoxins from the bloodbr
Sarsaparillas effective use in the treatment of leprosy has been documented in a 1959 human trialbr
The effectiveness of sarsaparilla in the treatment of adolescent acne caused by excessive androgens has received some experimental support as wellbr
Flavonoids in sarsaparilla have been documented to have immune modulation and liver protective activitiesbr
Clinical observations in China demonstrated that sarsaparilla was effective according to blood tests in about 90 of acute and 50 of chronic cases of syphilisbr
Other studies have show the antibiotic antifungal and antimycobacterial properties of the rootbr
Its antiinflammatory activity has been demonstrated in several in vitro and in vivo studiesbr
The root has been reported to have stimulatory activity on the kidneys in humans and in chronic nephritis it was shown to increase the urinary excretion of uric acidbr
br
Saponins and plant steroids found in many species of plants including sarsaparilla can be synthesized into human steroids such as oestrogen and testosterone This synthesis has never been documented to occur in the human body  only in the laboratorybr
The steroids sarsasapogenin and smilagenin have been claimed to have the ability to treat senile dementia cognitive dysfunction and Alzheimers disease Any studies to substantiate these claims however have not yet been published in peerreviewed papersbr
br
In modern herbalism the root is considered anodyne antibacterial antibiotic antifungal antiinflammatory blood cleanser depurative diaphoretic diuretic digestive febrifuge hepatic and tonicbr
