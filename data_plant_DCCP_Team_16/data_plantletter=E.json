relieve toothache or to help to loosen the tooth and render extraction easierbr\nbr\r\nThe latex contains esters of the diterpene tigliane type alcohols 12deoxyphorbol and 12deoxy16hydroxyphorbol the diterpene daphnane type alcohol resiniferonol and several esters of the macrocyclic diterpene alcohol 19hydroxyingol eg The pentacyclic euphorianin Most compounds isolated are mono and diesters of 12deoxyphorbol Daphnane esters are generally known for their potent skin irritant properties whereas tigliane esters are toxic and tumour promoters however some of the tigliane compounds especially 12deoxyphorbol derivatives possess anticancer activitiesbr\r\nThe variety of irritant compounds present in high concentrations is reflected by the irritant activity of the latex which is more than 30 times stronger in Euphorbia poissonii latex ID50  01 \u03bcg  5 \u03bcl than in the latex of eg Euphorbia unispina although after 24 hours both activities have almost the same value The isolated

DPP  12deoxyphorbol 13phenylacetate are also strongly irritant The irritant activity of resiniferatoxin and tinyatoxin is rapid It reaches a maximum within 4 hours and then fades to inactivity after 24 hoursbr\r\nResiniferatoxin and tinyatoxin are highly toxic as they bind to pain receptors in the same way as capsaicin but much more powerfully They stimulate the neurons to fire repeatedly until the neuron dies causing searing pain and sending the victim into severe anaphylactic shock Resiniferatoxin is used in the treatment of incontinence associated with an overactive bladder It also has antifeedant and analgesic properties Efforts have been made to synthesize this compound In laboratory tests DPP induced the expression of HIV1 in latently infected T cells and rendered them sensitive to killing by an immunotoxin DPP is 20 to 40fold more potent than the related phorbol ester prostratin and the combination of high potency and antitumour promoting activity makes DPP an attractive candidate for therapy of HIV1 infectionbr\r\nDuring further phytochemical studies on the latex derivatives of 19hydroxyingol were isolated These compounds showed cytotoxic activities against 6 human solid tumour cell lines lung carcinoma breast carcinoma colon adrenocarcinoma kidney carcinoma prostate adenocarcinoma and pancreatic carcinoma Moreover most of the 12deoxyphorbol ester derivatives
