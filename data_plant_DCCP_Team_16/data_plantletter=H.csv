The plant contains several medically active compounds An antitumor iridoid compound and two depsides showing inhibitory activity of monoamine oxidase B MAOB have been isolated from the bark In addition two iridoid chemicals called plumericin and isoplumericin have been found in the bark and the latex These two chemicals have been reported with cytotoxic anticancer antifungal and antibacterial actions in laboratory researchbr
An extract of the bark has been shown to  provide significant protection from ulcers and to reduce gastric hypersecretion through several novel mechanisms of actionsbr
The latex has shown significant antiinflammatory and pain relieving actions The latex can exert antiinflammatory effects even in the acute phase of the inflammatory process This action has been attributed to the cinnamate chemicals that are found in the latex and barkbr
The bark has been shown to be significantly cytotoxic to five different human cancer cell lines which may help explain why the tree has been used against cancer and tumours for many years in South America This anticancerous action is probably related to the iridoids and triterpenoids in the tree barkbr
Research has shown that the bark has a greater antifungal effect than a control drug nistatin that was used  this action has been attributed to the triterpenic esters found in the barkbr
The plants effectiveness in treating infected wounds candida tuberculosis syphilis and even mange might be explained by the documented antimicrobial actions of the bark and latexbr
The plants use in the treatment of asthma might be explained by the smoothmuscle relaxant actions documented in 2005 by Brazilian researchers working with a bark extractbr

The alkaloid holarrhenine also found in the plant has narcotic and local anaesthetic properties but in contrast is also an irritantbr

Considerable research has been carried out into the medical applications of these plants most of which has tended to bear out its traditional usesbr
The stem bark root bark and seeds yield more than 40 alkaloids The highest concentration is found in the stem bark and root bark with up to 43 but only 04 has been reported for flowering plants The leaves contain 1  15 and the seeds 06  18 According to the Pharmacopoeia of India the bark should contain about 2 alkaloidsbr
Most of the alkaloids of the stem bark and root bark are steroid alkaloids derived from conanine or the closely related conamine which also occur in other Holarrhena species The main alkaloid of the stem bark and root bark is conessine other compounds are norconessine kurchine conessimine kurchamine kurchessine kurcholessine conimine conamine and holarrheninebr
The leaves contain mainly steroid alkaloids derived from pregnane such as holarrhimine holaphyllamine holamine and holaphylline as well as the alkaloid triacanthine an adenine derivative Various aminoglycosteroids are also present in the leaves These substances contain an aminosugar and in some of them eg holarosine and holacurtine the steroidal part of the molecule is a cardenolide br
The seeds contain conessine norconessine conamine and conarrhiminebr
Conessine has sedative central nervous system depressant cardiac depressant antipyretic and analgesic activities It also has significant antiamoebic activity but it needs to be used with caution because it can produce neurological problems such as vertigo tremors insomnia agitation or anxiety Conessine also shows antibacterial and antifungal activities against a range of human pathogens in vitrobr
Several other steroidal alkaloids also show antibacterial and antifungal activitiesbr
The steroid alkaloids present in the stem bark and root bark have hypotensive activity and are simultaneously local anaesthetic and spasmolytic but they are also cardiotoxicbr
Triacanthine also has hypotensive activity but is also cardiotonic antispasmodic and a respiratory analeptic In addition triacanthine stimulates the development of mature red blood cellsbr
Many of the pregnane derivatives can be used as a starting material for the partial synthesis of pharmaceutical steroids such as adrenocortical hormones corticosteroids and sex hormones eg oestrogens progestrogens and androgensbr
Holamine holaphyllamine and holaphylline show significant antiinflammatory propertiesbr
