The highest concentrations of alkaloids occur in the root bark 5  6 followed by the roots 1  25 stem bark 2 seed 1 and leaves 04  08br
Ibogaine ibogan class is the most important alkaloid present in all plant parts except the seeds The main activities of ibogaine are on the central nervous system and on the cardiovascular system At low doses it exerts primarily a stimulant effect increasing alertness and reducing fatigue hunger and thirst At higher doses the primary effects are hallucinations with unpleasant possible side effects such as anxiety and depression with fear or rage The peak effect is reached 1  3 hours after swallowing the drug it subsides gradually ending in complete insomnia and lethargy These effects can last for 2  5 days Apart from the psychological effects the physical effects include tremor light sensitivity nausea and vomiting loss of muscular coordination and prolonged and often painful muscle spasms all in a dosedependent waybr
Toxic doses may produce convulsions paralysis and death from respiratory arrestbr
Most activities have been tested with purified ibogaine but during initiation ceremonies powdered root bark is usually taken which is more powerful as it contains a range of related alkaloidsbr
Ibogaine is a potent cholinesterase inhibitor and the root extract is even 100 times stronger in its inhibitory effect because of the additional effects of the alkaloids tabernanthine ibogamine and the more distantly related iboluteine This property contributes to the antifatigue properties of ibogaine and results from an increased sensitivity to adrenaline bringing about a transient excited state of the sympathic nervous systembr
Despite the reputation of iboga as an aphrodisiac ibogaine did not produce a stimulation of sexual functions in various trialsbr
Tests have not shown ibogaine to have a significant analgesic effectbr
Recent research indicates that ibogaine has a novel pharmacological mechanism of action acting strongly on a variety of different receptors in the brain resulting from complex interactions between neurotransmitter systems There is no consensus yet on how ibogaine works precisely but it is known to inhibit the reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin which can cause hallucinations However the suggestion by laymen that ibogaine has considerable potential in the field of psychotherapy is premature Research has shown that ibogaine is converted in the liver to noribogaine which fills opiate receptors thus eliminating withdrawal symptoms Ibogaine also stimulates nicotinic receptors in the cerebellum which contributes to modulating the dopamine reward circuit At high doses though ibogaine is toxic as it destroys neurons in the cerebellumbr
There is evidence to suggest that ibogaine has considerable potential in treating addictions to heroin cocaine alcohol nicotine caffeine amphetamine desoxyephedrine or methadone or combinations of these Several methods to arrest the physiological and psychological aspects of dependency on drugs by using ibogaine have been patented in the United States Treatments are claimed to be effective for 70  100 of the cases However the serious side effects of ibogaine make its use potentially harmful and additional clinical studies are needed to determine if and how it can be used safelybr
