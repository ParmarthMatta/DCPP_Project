The lipophilic flavonoids of which sinensetin and tetramethylscutellarein are the most abundant have shown inhibitory effect against Ehrlich ascites tumour cells in vitro Additionally these flavonoids may be partially responsible for antiinflammatory effects since flavonoids are inhibitors of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenasebr
