traditional use in the treatment of amoebic dysentery throughout the distribution area of the plant The stem bark is listed in the Pharmacopoeia of India Although slow in action compared with emetine it is less toxic and can be administered orally The seeds or bark are sometimes adulterated with those of Wrightia tinctoria which do not have the same medicinal properties although both show antibacterial activitybr\r\nConsiderable research has been carried out into the medical applications of these plants most of which has tended to bear out its traditional usesbr\r\nThe stem bark root bark and seeds yield more than 40 alkaloids The highest concentration is found in the stem bark and root bark with up to 43 but only 04 has been reported for flowering plants The leaves contain 1  15 and the seeds 06  18 According to the Pharmacopoeia of India the bark should contain about 2 alkaloidsbr\r\nMost of the alkaloids of the stem bark and root bark are steroid alkaloids derived from conanine or the closely related conamine which also occur in other Holarrhena species The main alkaloid of the stem bark and root bark is conessine other compounds are norconessine kurchine conessimine kurchamine kurchessine kurcholessine conimine conamine and holarrheninebr\r\nThe leaves contain mainly steroid alkaloids derived from pregnane such as holarrhimine holaphyllamine holamine and holaphylline as well as the alkaloid triacanthine an adenine derivative Various aminoglycosteroids are also present in the leaves These substances contain an aminosugar and in some of them eg holarosine and holacurtine the steroidal part of the molecule is a cardenolide br\r\nThe seeds contain conessine norconessine conamine and conarrhiminebr\r\nConessine has sedative central nervous system depressant cardiac depressant antipyretic and analgesic activities It also has significant antiamoebic activity but it needs to be used with caution because it can produce neurological problems such as vertigo tremors insomnia agitation or anxiety Conessine also shows antibacterial and antifungal activities against a range of human pathogens in vitrobr\r\nSeveral other steroidal alkaloids also show antibacterial and antifungal activitiesbr\r\nThe steroid alkaloids present in the stem bark and root bark have hypotensive activity and are simultaneously local anaesthetic and spasmolytic but they are also cardiotoxicbr\r\nTriacanthine also has hypotensive activity but is also cardiotonic antispasmodic and a respiratory analeptic In addition triacanthine stimulates the development of mature red blood cellsbr\r\nMany of the pregnane derivatives can be used as a starting material for the partial synthesis of pharmaceutical steroids such as adrenocortical hormones corticosteroids and sex hormones eg oestrogens progestrogens and androgensbr\r\nHolamine holaphyllamine and holaphylline show significant antiinflammatory propertiesbr\r\nAqueous extracts of the root bark stem bark or
