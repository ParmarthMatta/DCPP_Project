where the plant is cultivated it is considered the first treatment for any type of scratch bite or burn and is used in hospitals as a primary treatment for burns up to the third degree Worldwide attention was drawn to the possible value of the gel prepared from this and other Aloe species after the second World War when skin burns of victims of the nuclear bombs on Japan were successfully treated with itbr\r\nThe gel of this species contains much higher concentrations of the primary compounds present in other aloes and this higher concentration is responsible for the faster and more effective action of the gel against skin conditionsbr\r\nAs in most Aloe species the leaf exudate of this species contains anthraquinone derivatives such as aloin and hydroxyaloinsbr\r\nAlthough aloin is inactive as a laxative it is activated in the digestive tract by Eubacterium species to the compound aloeemodin anthrone which is an effective laxativebr\r\nAlthough some observations indicate that in diarrhoea induced by aloin increased water content might be more important than stimulated peristalsis the side effects of prolonged use point to a griping effect on the colon Therefore aloin should preferably be administered in combination with an antispasmodic to moderate its griping actionbr\r\nIn any case anthraquinone laxatives should not be used for longer than 8  10 days or by children younger than 12 years Contraindications also include pregnancy breastfeeding intestinal inflammations and haemorrhoidsbr\r\nPossible side effects of aloin include congestion and irritation of the pelvic organs Anthraquinone laxatives may play a role in development of colorectal cancer as they have genotoxic potential and also tumorigenic potential in rodentsbr\r\nIt has been claimed that aloin is also responsible for antihistamine and antiinflammatory activitybr\r\nBoth aloin and aloeresin B have skinwhitening activitybr\r\nThe gel contains polysaccharides and glycoproteins Apart from

vera","Family_name":"Asphodelaceae","Local_name":"","Common_name":"Aloe Vera","Parts_used":"stem,leave,pulp,exudate,sap","Medicinal_Use":"Aloe vera is a well known herbal preparation with a long history of use It is widely used in modern herbal practice and is often available in proprietary herbal preparations All parts of the plant can be used but the two most common parts being the clear gel contained within the leaves and the bitter exudate at the base of the leafbr\nbr\r\nAloe vera gel has earned a reputation as a miracle drug It is effective in burn treatment because of its antiinflammatory and woundhealing properties Its healing properties may be due to rehydrating insulating and protective activities resulting from the high water content The major constituents are polysaccharides mainly acemannan lectins sterols and enzymes and the effect is assumed to be a synergy between the polysaccharide base and various components In addition acemannan has shown immune stimulating anticancer and antiviral effectsbr\r\nSeveral studies on both topical and oral treatments with the gel have shown a positive influence on the synthesis of glycosamino glycans thereby facilitating wound healingbr\r\nA placebocontrolled doubleblind study showed that a topically applied gel of 05 in a hydrophylic cream is beneficial for patients suffering from psoriasis It did not show toxic or other sideeffectsbr\r\nA clinical test with patients with advanced solid tumours for whom no standard effective therapy was available suggested that the gel in combination with the immunomodulating neurohormone melatonin may produce some therapeutic benefits at least in terms of stabilization of disease and survivalbr\r\nThe dried exudate of bitter aloes contains 15  40 anthraquinone derivatives such as aloin and hydroxyaloins Furthermore the exudate contains the pyrone derivative aloenin and aloeresinsbr\r\nThe compound responsible for the laxative properties is aloin which itself is inactive as a laxative but is activated to aloeemodin anthrone in the body by the action of Eubacterium speciesbr\r\nIt has been claimed that aloin is responsible for antihistamine and antiinflammatory activitybr\r\nBoth aloin and aloeresin B have skinwhitening activitybr\r\nLarge variations in aloin content have been found in Aloe vera with the highest concentration in exudates from younger mature leavesbr\r\nContradicting results of clinical tests with Aloe vera products are common A problem is that the identity of the tested plants is not always certain A second problem is that the products are not of standard composition but depend on cultivar growing conditions and handling after harvest Therefore commercial products may vary enormously in composition Also contamination of the gel with exudate can turn a harmless product into a purgative It is therefore imperative that products of welldefined composition are used for clinical trials that the identity of the plant is confirmed by a taxonomist and that a specimen is deposited in a herbarium for future referencebr\nbr\r\nThe clear gel contained within the leaf makes an excellent treatment for wounds burns and a host of other skin disorders placing a protective coat over the affected area speeding up the rate of healing and reducing the risk of infection The gel is also applied externally to cure haemorrhoids These actions are in part due to the presence of aloectin B which stimulates the immune system To obtain this gel the leaves can be cut in half along their length and the inner pulp rubbed over the affected area of skin This has an immediate soothing effect on all sorts of burns and other skin problemsbr\r\nThe use of the gel has been approved in the United States for the treatment of leukaemia in cats of fibrosarcoma in dogs for wound healing in humans and to prevent dry socket \u2018alveolar osteitis\u2019 in humansbr\r\nThe peeled leaves are eaten to relieve sore throat and coughs and as a mild laxative As a food supplement the leaf gel is said to facilitate digestion and to improve blood and lymphatic circulation as well as kidney liver and gall bladder functions There are claims of beneficial activity of Aloe vera products in cases of AIDS arthritis or other chronic and debilitating conditions However these claims have not been substantiated by scientific studies There is also no evidence that topical Aloe vera gel is effective in preventing or minimizing radiationinduced skin reactions in cancer patients In large amounts the gel has antiirritant propertiesbr\nbr\r\nA bitter substance is obtained from the yellow sap at the base of the leaf Known as \u2018bitter aloes\u2019 it contains anthraquinones which are a useful digestive stimulant and a strong laxative It also has vermicidal properties It is taken internally in the treatment of chronic constipation poor appetite digestive problems etc Mixed with other ingredients to mask its bitter taste it is taken against asthma and to treat coughs Similar mixtures are taken to cure dysentery kidney problems or against dyspepsia It should be administered preferably in combination with an antispasmodic to moderate its griping actionbr\r\nIt is applied externally as a refrigerant to treat acne or cutsbr\r\nCura\u00e7ao aloe should contain at least 28 hydroxyanthraquinone derivatives it is almost entirely soluble in 60 alcohol and for more than 70 in water It should not contain more than 12 moisture and 3 ashbr\r\nThe plant is strongly purgative so great care should be taken over the dosage br\r\nAnthraquinonebased laxatives such as bitter aloes should not be used longer than 8  10 days nor by children younger than 12 years Contraindications include pregnancy breastfeeding intestinal inflammations and haemorrhoidsbr\r\nWhen plants are grown in pots the anthraquinone content is greatly reducedbr\nbr\r\nThe plant is emmenagogue emollient
