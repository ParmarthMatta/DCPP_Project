Iboga is usually taken in large quantities in these ceremoniesbr\r\nIboga is also taken usually in rather smaller quantities as a means of divination to diagnose situations and also for therapeutic purposes The roots are considered to be aphrodisiac febrifuge and tonic A decoction is often taken as a means of combating tiredness hunger and thirst in situations such as hunting when it can be necessary to overcome physical stress A root macerate in palm wine is taken to soothe coughs whilst the root decoction is drunk to treat urinary infections The pounded roots are also used in the curing ceremony called zebola for treating psychosomatic afflictionsbr\r\nA decoction of the root is used for eye drops to treat conjunctivitisbr\nbr\r\nThe leaves are considered to be anaesthetic and aphrodisiacbr\r\nThe warmed leaves are rubbed on the gums to calm toothachebr\nbr\r\nThe latex obtained from the plant is taken as an anthelminticbr\nbr\r\nThe active compounds present in the root root bark stem bark leaves and seeds of the plant are indole alkaloids About 20 have been identified so farbr\r\nThe highest concentrations of alkaloids occur in the root bark 5  6 followed by the roots 1  25 stem bark 2 seed 1 and leaves 04  08br\r\nIbogaine ibogan class is the most important alkaloid present in all plant parts except the seeds The main activities of ibogaine are on the central nervous system and on the cardiovascular system At low doses it exerts primarily a stimulant effect increasing alertness and reducing fatigue hunger and thirst At higher doses the primary effects are hallucinations with unpleasant possible side effects such as anxiety and depression with fear or rage The peak effect is reached 1  3 hours after swallowing the drug it subsides gradually ending in complete insomnia and lethargy These effects can last for 2  5 days Apart from the psychological effects the physical effects include tremor light sensitivity nausea and vomiting loss of muscular coordination and prolonged and often painful muscle spasms all in a dosedependent waybr\r\nToxic doses may produce convulsions paralysis and death from respiratory arrestbr\r\nMost activities have been tested with purified ibogaine but during initiation ceremonies powdered root bark is usually taken which is more powerful as it contains a range of related alkaloidsbr\r\nIbogaine is a potent cholinesterase inhibitor and the root extract is even 100 times stronger in its inhibitory effect because of the additional effects of the alkaloids tabernanthine ibogamine and the more distantly related iboluteine This property contributes to the antifatigue properties of ibogaine and results from an increased sensitivity to adrenaline bringing about a transient excited state of the sympathic nervous systembr\r\nDespite the reputation of iboga as an aphrodisiac ibogaine did not produce a stimulation of sexual functions in various trialsbr\r\nTests have not shown ibogaine to have a significant analgesic effectbr\r\nRecent research indicates that ibogaine has a novel pharmacological mechanism of action acting strongly on a variety of different receptors in the brain resulting from complex interactions between neurotransmitter systems There is no consensus yet on how ibogaine works precisely but it is known to inhibit the reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin which can cause hallucinations However the suggestion by laymen that ibogaine has considerable potential in the field of psychotherapy is premature Research has shown that ibogaine is converted in the liver to noribogaine which fills opiate receptors thus eliminating withdrawal symptoms Ibogaine also stimulates nicotinic receptors in the cerebellum which contributes to modulating the dopamine reward circuit At high doses though ibogaine is toxic as it destroys neurons in the cerebellumbr\r\nThere is evidence to suggest that ibogaine has considerable potential in treating addictions to heroin cocaine alcohol nicotine caffeine amphetamine desoxyephedrine or methadone or combinations of these Several methods to arrest the physiological and psychological aspects of dependency on drugs by using ibogaine have been patented in the United States Treatments are claimed to be effective for 70  100 of the cases However the serious side effects of ibogaine make its use potentially harmful and additional clinical studies are needed to determine if and how it can be used safelybr\n"},{"Species_Name":"Tacca
