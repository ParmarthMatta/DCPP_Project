commonly exported to Germany and various other countries Research has confirmed the presence of a number of medically active compounds and also the diuretic action of the leavesbr\r\nThe leaves contain flavones including sinensetin saponins a glycoside orthosiphonin an essential oil and large amounts of potassium which is largely responsible for the diuretic effectbr\r\nIn tests with healthy volunteers in Thailand extracts of the plant increased excretion of citrate and oxalate Although a higher level of oxalate may increase the risk of kidney stones the increased citrate output helps prevent stone formationbr\r\nIt has been demonstrated that Java tea has antimicrobial properties Aqueous extracts markedly inhibited the growth of both grampositive and gramnegative bacteria Saponins may play a role in bacteriostatic activity in vitro Caffeic acid derivatives which represent as much as 95 of the phenolic substances present in a hot water extract may also be responsible for the antibiotic activitybr\r\nThe lipophilic flavonoids of which sinensetin and tetramethylscutellarein are the most abundant have shown inhibitory effect against Ehrlich ascites tumour cells in vitro Additionally these flavonoids may be partially responsible for antiinflammatory effects since flavonoids are inhibitors of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenasebr\r\nThe crude herb is said to cause
