Dtubocurarine is also used to treat tetanus which causes uncontrollable muscle contractions throughout the body And is also being evaluated for its role in blocking serotonin reducing vomiting alleviating drug withdrawal symptoms and for its antianxiety effects Dtubocurarine also stimulates the release of histamine which may cause lowered blood pressure due to relaxation of blood vesselsbr

The resin or sap is a storehouse of phytochemicals including proanthocyanidins antioxidants simple phenols diterpenes phytosterols and biologically active alkaloids and lignans Scientists have attributed many of the biologically active properties of the sap especially its woundhealing capacity to two main active constituents an alkaloid named taspine and a lignan named dimethylcedrusinebr
Taspine has been shown to have antiinflammatory antitumor  and antiviral actions and to be active against the herpes virusbr
The lignan ‘dimethylcedrusine’ has been shown to play a central role in the resin’s effective woundhealing action The study revealed that the crude resin stimulated contraction of wounds helped in the formation of a crustscab at the wound site regenerated skin more rapidly and assisted in the formation of new collagenbr
Other phytochemicals including phenolic compounds proanthocyanadins and diterpenes have shown potent antibacterial activity against E Coli and Bacillus subtilis as well as woundhealing properties Research has shown that the resin is a potent costeffective treatment for gastrointestinal ulcers and distress via antimicrobial antiinflammatory and sensory afferentdependent actionsbr
The resin has also shown an in vitro effect against stomach cancer and colon cancer cells It inhibits the growth of a human myelogenous leukaemia cell line and also prevents cells from mutating in test tube studiesbr

For external use the resin is rubbed directly on the affected area several times daily and allowed to dry Please note the resin is red It will temporarily stain the skin a reddishbrown which will wash off but it will permanently stain clothing Rubbing the resin in the palm of the hand first or directly where applied will thicken the resin into a thin lighter coloured paste which helps form a second skin on top of a wound or rash and reduces stainingbr
