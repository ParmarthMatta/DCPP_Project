paederoside displaying the highest degree of antitumorpromoting activity Scandoside has been shown to promote the growth of lettuce seedlings Paederoside showed a similar inhibitory activity to that of asperuloside and daecetylasperulosidic acid in a plant growth inhibition test and in an antimicroorganism activity testbr\r\nThe bruised aerial parts of the plant have the fetid odour of indole methylmercaptan Damage to the tissue releases an enzyme which splits off this sulphurcontaining group from paederoside and is therefore responsible for the unpleasant odour The most abundant sulphurcontaining compound was dimethyl disulphidebr\r\nThe presence of alkaloids and an essential oil have also been recorded Monoterpenes such as linalol constitute the major components in the
