The gel of this species contains much higher concentrations of the primary compounds present in other aloes and this higher concentration is responsible for the faster and more effective action of the gel against skin conditionsbr
As in most Aloe species the leaf exudate of this species contains anthraquinone derivatives such as aloin and hydroxyaloinsbr
Although aloin is inactive as a laxative it is activated in the digestive tract by Eubacterium species to the compound aloeemodin anthrone which is an effective laxativebr
Although some observations indicate that in diarrhoea induced by aloin increased water content might be more important than stimulated peristalsis the side effects of prolonged use point to a griping effect on the colon Therefore aloin should preferably be administered in combination with an antispasmodic to moderate its griping actionbr
In any case anthraquinone laxatives should not be used for longer than 8  10 days or by children younger than 12 years Contraindications also include pregnancy breastfeeding intestinal inflammations and haemorrhoidsbr
Possible side effects of aloin include congestion and irritation of the pelvic organs Anthraquinone laxatives may play a role in development of colorectal cancer as they have genotoxic potential and also tumorigenic potential in rodentsbr
It has been claimed that aloin is also responsible for antihistamine and antiinflammatory activitybr
Both aloin and aloeresin B have skinwhitening activitybr
The gel contains polysaccharides and glycoproteins Apart from mannan and glucomannan arboran A and arboran B have been identified which have hypoglycaemic effects The structurefunction relationship of polysaccharides from gel from different Aloe species is still subject to research Biological activity is thought to be at least partly due to immunomodulating effects of these polysaccharidesbr

br
Aloe vera gel has earned a reputation as a miracle drug It is effective in burn treatment because of its antiinflammatory and woundhealing properties Its healing properties may be due to rehydrating insulating and protective activities resulting from the high water content The major constituents are polysaccharides mainly acemannan lectins sterols and enzymes and the effect is assumed to be a synergy between the polysaccharide base and various components In addition acemannan has shown immune stimulating anticancer and antiviral effectsbr
Several studies on both topical and oral treatments with the gel have shown a positive influence on the synthesis of glycosamino glycans thereby facilitating wound healingbr

A clinical test with patients with advanced solid tumours for whom no standard effective therapy was available suggested that the gel in combination with the immunomodulating neurohormone melatonin may produce some therapeutic benefits at least in terms of stabilization of disease and survivalbr
The dried exudate of bitter aloes contains 15  40 anthraquinone derivatives such as aloin and hydroxyaloins Furthermore the exudate contains the pyrone derivative aloenin and aloeresinsbr
The compound responsible for the laxative properties is aloin which itself is inactive as a laxative but is activated to aloeemodin anthrone in the body by the action of Eubacterium speciesbr
It has been claimed that aloin is responsible for antihistamine and antiinflammatory activitybr
Both aloin and aloeresin B have skinwhitening activitybr
Large variations in aloin content have been found in Aloe vera with the highest concentration in exudates from younger mature leavesbr
Contradicting results of clinical tests with Aloe vera products are common A problem is that the identity of the tested plants is not always certain A second problem is that the products are not of standard composition but depend on cultivar growing conditions and handling after harvest Therefore commercial products may vary enormously in composition Also contamination of the gel with exudate can turn a harmless product into a purgative It is therefore imperative that products of welldefined composition are used for clinical trials that the identity of the plant is confirmed by a taxonomist and that a specimen is deposited in a herbarium for future referencebr

The latex is considered to be antiinflammatory antiparasitic antiseptic cholagogue and vulnerary The latex stimulates bile flow and has a general cleansing and tonic effect upon the body and so can be helpful in the treatment of a wide range of conditions Taken internally it is used traditionally to treat gastritis stomach ulcers intestinal inflammations rheumatism menstrual conditions hepatitisbr
Applied externally or taken as a gargle it is used as a healing agent to treat wounds and cuts to treat dermatitis and skin blemishes remove pimples from the skin and tongue to heal injured and inflamed gums to treat sore throats and other throat diseases to relieve toothachebr
br
The resin or sap is a storehouse of phytochemicals including proanthocyanidins antioxidants simple phenols diterpenes phytosterols and biologically active alkaloids and lignans Scientists have attributed many of the biologically active properties of the sap especially its woundhealing capacity to two main active constituents an alkaloid named taspine and a lignan named dimethylcedrusinebr
Taspine has been shown to have antiinflammatory antitumor  and antiviral actions and to be active against the herpes virusbr
The lignan ‘dimethylcedrusine’ has been shown to play a central role in the resin’s effective woundhealing action The study revealed that the crude resin stimulated contraction of wounds helped in the formation of a crustscab at the wound site regenerated skin more rapidly and assisted in the formation of new collagenbr
Other phytochemicals including phenolic compounds proanthocyanadins and diterpenes have shown potent antibacterial activity against E Coli and Bacillus subtilis as well as woundhealing properties Research has shown that the resin is a potent costeffective treatment for gastrointestinal ulcers and distress via antimicrobial antiinflammatory and sensory afferentdependent actionsbr
The resin has also shown an in vitro effect against stomach cancer and colon cancer cells It inhibits the growth of a human myelogenous leukaemia cell line and also prevents cells from mutating in test tube studiesbr

The bark contains several complex diterpenoid alkaloids which are esters of tricyclic diterpene acids with as main components alkaloids of the dimethylaminoethylester type eg Couminginebr
The alkaloids have a stimulant effect on the heart like the cardiac glycosides of Digitalis but the effect is very shortlastingbr
Coumingine has similar effects as cassaine and cassaidine which are major components in other Erythrophleum species They have strong anaesthetic and diuretic effects and increase contractions of the intestine and uterusbr
Apart from an increase of heart contraction in systole the alkaloids also demonstrated an increase in diastole In addition coumingine caused depressive effects Coumingine produced severe and longlasting diarrhoea when given orallybr

The bark contains the alkaloids cassaine cassaidine and erythrophleguine The alkaloid content ranges from 02 to 11 In high doses the bark extract is an extremely strong rapidacting cardiac poison in warmblooded animals causing shortness of breath seizures and cardiac arrest in a few minutesbr
The alkaloids have a stimulant effect on the heart similar to that of the cardenolides digitoxine from Digitalis and ouabain from Strophanthus gratus but the effect is very shortlasting as the alkaloids are quickly metabolized in the organismbr
Cassaine and cassaidine have strong anaesthetic and diuretic effects and increase contractions of the intestine and uterus Apart from an increase of heart contraction in systole the alkaloids also demonstrated an increase in diastole In addition cassaidine caused depressive effects while cassaine caused a violent state of excitationbr
Although the alkaloid content in the seeds is markedly lower than in the stem bark the seeds are more toxic This strong activity is due to a strong haemolytic saponin which acts in a synergistic way with the alkaloidsbr

The bark extract has excellent local anaesthetic activity on eyes and skin although its use on the eye was disputed because of its irritant effect on the conjunctiva Trials using it as anaesthetic in operations or tooth extractions were less successful as symptoms of poisoning appeared in higher dosesbr

Norcassamidine has local anaesthetic action and is a convulsantbr
The bark further contains procyanidins polyphenols and hence has antioxidant properties The relaxant effect of the bark extract of Erythrophleum suaveolens is due to its procyanidinsbr
The bark also contains the trihydroxystilbene resveratrol Resveratrol shows antiplatelet aggregation coronary vasodilator antileukaemic antifungal and proteintyrosine kinase inhibitory activities Trihydroxystilbenes are thought to protect against atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease Resveratrol is however only registered as a food supplement not as a medicinebr
The bark contains the flavone luteolin that colours orange after addition of magnesium powder and a few drops of hydrochloric acid This reaction allows it to be distinguished from the bark of Erythrophleum africanum which colours violet after treatment because of the presence of 23dihydroxymyricetinbr

Several of the active compounds in this plant are good candidates to be developed into anticancer drugs considering the promising pharmacological studies and clinical trials results As the active compounds are complex molecules they have not yet been chemically produced and can only be obtained directly from the plant More research into largescale production and mechanisation of cultivation and latex extraction is neededbr
The latex yields mostly diterpenes of the jatrophane pepluane and ingenane types Jatrophane and pepluane diterpenes are noninflammatory whereas ingenane diterpenes are responsible for the irritant and tumourpromoting properties of the latexbr
Of the pepluane esters pepluanone showed significant antiinflammatory activity in vivobr
The most active compound is a hydrophobic diterpene ester ingenol 3angelate PEP005 an irritant compound which possesses topical antitumour activity against human cancer cell lines It has given more than 90 complete responses on different skin cancers in a Phase II clinical trial and has emerged as a potential new topical antiskin cancer PEP005 also has potent antileukaemic effects and a powerful inhibitory activity against a wide range of other tumours tested including breast cancer cellsbr

The variety of irritant compounds present in high concentrations is reflected by the irritant activity of the latex which is more than 30 times stronger in Euphorbia poissonii latex ID50  01 μg  5 μl than in the latex of eg Euphorbia unispina although after 24 hours both activities have almost the same value The isolated aromatic esters of the daphnane type are more potent irritants in mouse ear tests than the aromatic tigliane esters especially resiniferatoxin ID50  000021 nMol  5 μg and tinyatoxin ID50  00012 nMol  5 μg Of the 6 isolated aromatic tigliane esters the highly irritant 12deoxyphorbol13Ophenylacetate20Oacetate ID50  0075 nMol  5 μg is the major compound candletoxin A candletoxin B and DPP  12deoxyphorbol 13phenylacetate are also strongly irritant The irritant activity of resiniferatoxin and tinyatoxin is rapid It reaches a maximum within 4 hours and then fades to inactivity after 24 hoursbr
Resiniferatoxin and tinyatoxin are highly toxic as they bind to pain receptors in the same way as capsaicin but much more powerfully They stimulate the neurons to fire repeatedly until the neuron dies causing searing pain and sending the victim into severe anaphylactic shock Resiniferatoxin is used in the treatment of incontinence associated with an overactive bladder It also has antifeedant and analgesic properties Efforts have been made to synthesize this compound In laboratory tests DPP induced the expression of HIV1 in latently infected T cells and rendered them sensitive to killing by an immunotoxin DPP is 20 to 40fold more potent than the related phorbol ester prostratin and the combination of high potency and antitumour promoting activity makes DPP an attractive candidate for therapy of HIV1 infectionbr
During further phytochemical studies on the latex derivatives of 19hydroxyingol were isolated These compounds showed cytotoxic activities against 6 human solid tumour cell lines lung carcinoma breast carcinoma colon adrenocarcinoma kidney carcinoma prostate adenocarcinoma and pancreatic carcinoma Moreover most of the 12deoxyphorbol ester derivatives showed selective cytotoxicity for the human kidney carcinoma cell line with potencies for one compound exceeding those of the anticancer drug adriamycin by 10000 timesbr

Of all the alkaloids present conessine has attracted special attention for its antidysenteric and antiamoebic properties It is claimed to be as effective as emetine and active in cases resistant to the latter and even on the cysts and to be less toxic It is also hypotensive and a cardiac depressantbr
The alkaloid holarrhenine also found in the plant has narcotic and local anaesthetic properties but in contrast is also an irritantbr
Recent work has shown interesting development in the isolation of steroidal hormones and in particular of progesterone a socalled ‘sexhormone’ and a precursor of hydrocortisonebr

Considerable research has been carried out into the medical applications of these plants most of which has tended to bear out its traditional usesbr
The stem bark root bark and seeds yield more than 40 alkaloids The highest concentration is found in the stem bark and root bark with up to 43 but only 04 has been reported for flowering plants The leaves contain 1  15 and the seeds 06  18 According to the Pharmacopoeia of India the bark should contain about 2 alkaloidsbr
Most of the alkaloids of the stem bark and root bark are steroid alkaloids derived from conanine or the closely related conamine which also occur in other Holarrhena species The main alkaloid of the stem bark and root bark is conessine other compounds are norconessine kurchine conessimine kurchamine kurchessine kurcholessine conimine conamine and holarrheninebr
The leaves contain mainly steroid alkaloids derived from pregnane such as holarrhimine holaphyllamine holamine and holaphylline as well as the alkaloid triacanthine an adenine derivative Various aminoglycosteroids are also present in the leaves These substances contain an aminosugar and in some of them eg holarosine and holacurtine the steroidal part of the molecule is a cardenolide br
The seeds contain conessine norconessine conamine and conarrhiminebr
Conessine has sedative central nervous system depressant cardiac depressant antipyretic and analgesic activities It also has significant antiamoebic activity but it needs to be used with caution because it can produce neurological problems such as vertigo tremors insomnia agitation or anxiety Conessine also shows antibacterial and antifungal activities against a range of human pathogens in vitrobr
Several other steroidal alkaloids also show antibacterial and antifungal activitiesbr
The steroid alkaloids present in the stem bark and root bark have hypotensive activity and are simultaneously local anaesthetic and spasmolytic but they are also cardiotoxicbr
Triacanthine also has hypotensive activity but is also cardiotonic antispasmodic and a respiratory analeptic In addition triacanthine stimulates the development of mature red blood cellsbr
Many of the pregnane derivatives can be used as a starting material for the partial synthesis of pharmaceutical steroids such as adrenocortical hormones corticosteroids and sex hormones eg oestrogens progestrogens and androgensbr
Holamine holaphyllamine and holaphylline show significant antiinflammatory propertiesbr

Fresh leaves of Lunasia amara yield 01  015 of an essential oil which is almost entirely sesquiterpenoid in nature The principal sesquiterpenes are GAMMAelemene 07  19 germacreneD 18  51 and bicyclogermacrene 7  26 There are lesser amounts of bicycloelemene 1  2 BETAbourbonene 07  3 BETAelemene 4  9 ALFAfarnesene 1  3 and DELTAcadinene 3  5br
Some 13 alkaloids have been identified from several parts of the plant Of these lunacrine which is the principle alkaloid found in the leaves and lunasin a related quaternary furoquinoline both show a distinct action on muscles evidenced by a continually increasing tone and a rapid diminution of the power of response of the muscle to stimulation This action on muscular tone is seen not only upon isolated voluntary and smooth muscles but also upon the blood vessel walls where a distinct contraction occurs and upon the heart where a distinct diminution in the contractions was observed The lethal effect of both alkaloids is due to stoppage of respiration simultaneously with that of the circulationbr

The most important active compounds in the root are a range of plant steroids and saponins other compounds present include flavonoidsbr

11669,Tabernanthe iboga,Apocynaceae,,Iboga,"root,stem,leave,latex,bark,seed","Iboga root is very important in the initiation ceremonies of certain African tribes The root bark can be eaten whole or it can be crushed and ground then rolled into small balls sometimes it is mixed with other ingredients sometimes it is taken as a decoction of the crushed roots The root is mainly employed as a hallucinogenic a catalyst for spiritual discovery and to seek information from ancestors and the spirit world hence coming to terms with death Iboga is usually taken in large quantities in these ceremoniesbr
Iboga is also taken usually in rather smaller quantities as a means of divination to diagnose situations and also for therapeutic purposes The roots are considered to be aphrodisiac febrifuge and tonic A decoction is often taken as a means of combating tiredness hunger and thirst in situations such as hunting when it can be necessary to overcome physical stress A root macerate in palm wine is taken to soothe coughs whilst the root decoction is drunk to treat urinary infections The pounded roots are also used in the curing ceremony called zebola for treating psychosomatic afflictionsbr

br
The active compounds present in the root root bark stem bark leaves and seeds of the plant are indole alkaloids About 20 have been identified so farbr
The highest concentrations of alkaloids occur in the root bark 5  6 followed by the roots 1  25 stem bark 2 seed 1 and leaves 04  08br
Ibogaine ibogan class is the most important alkaloid present in all plant parts except the seeds The main activities of ibogaine are on the central nervous system and on the cardiovascular system At low doses it exerts primarily a stimulant effect increasing alertness and reducing fatigue hunger and thirst At higher doses the primary effects are hallucinations with unpleasant possible side effects such as anxiety and depression with fear or rage The peak effect is reached 1  3 hours after swallowing the drug it subsides gradually ending in complete insomnia and lethargy These effects can last for 2  5 days Apart from the psychological effects the physical effects include tremor light sensitivity nausea and vomiting loss of muscular coordination and prolonged and often painful muscle spasms all in a dosedependent waybr
Toxic doses may produce convulsions paralysis and death from respiratory arrestbr
Most activities have been tested with purified ibogaine but during initiation ceremonies powdered root bark is usually taken which is more powerful as it contains a range of related alkaloidsbr
Ibogaine is a potent cholinesterase inhibitor and the root extract is even 100 times stronger in its inhibitory effect because of the additional effects of the alkaloids tabernanthine ibogamine and the more distantly related iboluteine This property contributes to the antifatigue properties of ibogaine and results from an increased sensitivity to adrenaline bringing about a transient excited state of the sympathic nervous systembr
Despite the reputation of iboga as an aphrodisiac ibogaine did not produce a stimulation of sexual functions in various trialsbr
Tests have not shown ibogaine to have a significant analgesic effectbr
Recent research indicates that ibogaine has a novel pharmacological mechanism of action acting strongly on a variety of different receptors in the brain resulting from complex interactions between neurotransmitter systems There is no consensus yet on how ibogaine works precisely but it is known to inhibit the reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin which can cause hallucinations However the suggestion by laymen that ibogaine has considerable potential in the field of psychotherapy is premature Research has shown that ibogaine is converted in the liver to noribogaine which fills opiate receptors thus eliminating withdrawal symptoms Ibogaine also stimulates nicotinic receptors in the cerebellum which contributes to modulating the dopamine reward circuit At high doses though ibogaine is toxic as it destroys neurons in the cerebellumbr
There is evidence to suggest that ibogaine has considerable potential in treating addictions to heroin cocaine alcohol nicotine caffeine amphetamine desoxyephedrine or methadone or combinations of these Several methods to arrest the physiological and psychological aspects of dependency on drugs by using ibogaine have been patented in the United States Treatments are claimed to be effective for 70  100 of the cases However the serious side effects of ibogaine make its use potentially harmful and additional clinical studies are needed to determine if and how it can be used safelybr

An aqueous alcohol root extract showed positive cardioprotective and hepatoprotective effectsbr
A group of glycosides known as sitoindosides extracted from the roots showed significant antidepressant and anxietyrelieving properties In a test for chronic stress a root extract was compared with an extract from Panax ginseng both extracts had a positive effect on several chronic stress symptoms but the Withania somnifera extract did not cause the ginseng abuse syndrome indicating a different mode of actionbr
Cognition enhancing tests of an aqueous ethanol extract containing the glycosides withaferin A and sitoindosides showed a positive effect on cholinergic signal transduction in the forebrain which may partly explain its cognitionenhancing effectbr
Tests have shown that ashwagandha can reverse memory deficits and also have a consolidating effect on the memory Its effects upon the brain may provide leads towards treatments for Parkinson’s diseasebr
Aqueous alcohol extracts of the roots showed a positive effect on the cartilage of osteoarthritis patients both in vitro and in vivobr
The immunomodulatory effects of the withanolides a group of steroidal lactones have been studied extensively Enhanced white blood cell counts and activity and inhibition of delayedtype hypersensitivity are among the processes reportedbr
Glycowithanolides including sitoindosides IX and X have been shown to cause increased counts of platelets and red and white blood cells and increased activity of peritoneal macrophages and lysosomal enzymesbr
The properties of the root extracts are very promising in cancer therapy several studies indicate that they are correlated with the antioxidant effects The extracts not only affect tumour growth but also have positive adjuvant effects in radiation and chemotherapybr
In an invitro experiment the steroid lactone withaferin A inhibited growth in human cell lines of breast central nervous system colon and lung cancerbr
A chloroform extract of the plant prevented cell proliferation by disrupting mitosis and inhibiting angiogenesisbr
Addition of root powder to the diet has shown hypoglycaemic effectsbr
Although ashwagandha is used as an aphrodisiac adding root powder to the diet has impaired the libido and sexual performancebr
The methanolic extract of the roots has shown significant antibacterial activity against a range of bacteriabr
When studying the antisnakevenom properties of Withania somnifera it was found that a glycoprotein isolated from an aqueous extract of the plant neutralized the toxic effects of phospholipase A2 from cobra venom However its mode of action may be too slow to provide a basis for pharmacological developmentsbr
Side effects of the medicinal use of ashwagandha are rarely reported but a case of thyrotoxicosis caused by its use was reported in the Netherlands Symptoms disappeared when the treatment was stoppedbr
