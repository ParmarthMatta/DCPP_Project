The gel of this species contains much higher concentrations of the primary compounds present in other aloes and this higher concentration is responsible for the faster and more effective action of the gel against skin conditionsbr
As in most Aloe species the leaf exudate of this species contains anthraquinone derivatives such as aloin and hydroxyaloinsbr
Although aloin is inactive as a laxative it is activated in the digestive tract by Eubacterium species to the compound aloeemodin anthrone which is an effective laxativebr
Although some observations indicate that in diarrhoea induced by aloin increased water content might be more important than stimulated peristalsis the side effects of prolonged use point to a griping effect on the colon Therefore aloin should preferably be administered in combination with an antispasmodic to moderate its griping actionbr
In any case anthraquinone laxatives should not be used for longer than 8  10 days or by children younger than 12 years Contraindications also include pregnancy breastfeeding intestinal inflammations and haemorrhoidsbr
Possible side effects of aloin include congestion and irritation of the pelvic organs Anthraquinone laxatives may play a role in development of colorectal cancer as they have genotoxic potential and also tumorigenic potential in rodentsbr
It has been claimed that aloin is also responsible for antihistamine and antiinflammatory activitybr
Both aloin and aloeresin B have skinwhitening activitybr
The gel contains polysaccharides and glycoproteins Apart from mannan and glucomannan arboran A and arboran B have been identified which have hypoglycaemic effects The structurefunction relationship of polysaccharides from gel from different Aloe species is still subject to research Biological activity is thought to be at least partly due to immunomodulating effects of these polysaccharidesbr

br
Aloe vera gel has earned a reputation as a miracle drug It is effective in burn treatment because of its antiinflammatory and woundhealing properties Its healing properties may be due to rehydrating insulating and protective activities resulting from the high water content The major constituents are polysaccharides mainly acemannan lectins sterols and enzymes and the effect is assumed to be a synergy between the polysaccharide base and various components In addition acemannan has shown immune stimulating anticancer and antiviral effectsbr
Several studies on both topical and oral treatments with the gel have shown a positive influence on the synthesis of glycosamino glycans thereby facilitating wound healingbr
A placebocontrolled doubleblind study showed that a topically applied gel of 05 in a hydrophylic cream is beneficial for patients suffering from psoriasis It did not show toxic or other sideeffectsbr
A clinical test with patients with advanced solid tumours for whom no standard effective therapy was available suggested that the gel in combination with the immunomodulating neurohormone melatonin may produce some therapeutic benefits at least in terms of stabilization of disease and survivalbr
The dried exudate of bitter aloes contains 15  40 anthraquinone derivatives such as aloin and hydroxyaloins Furthermore the exudate contains the pyrone derivative aloenin and aloeresinsbr
The compound responsible for the laxative properties is aloin which itself is inactive as a laxative but is activated to aloeemodin anthrone in the body by the action of Eubacterium speciesbr
It has been claimed that aloin is responsible for antihistamine and antiinflammatory activitybr
Both aloin and aloeresin B have skinwhitening activitybr
Large variations in aloin content have been found in Aloe vera with the highest concentration in exudates from younger mature leavesbr
Contradicting results of clinical tests with Aloe vera products are common A problem is that the identity of the tested plants is not always certain A second problem is that the products are not of standard composition but depend on cultivar growing conditions and handling after harvest Therefore commercial products may vary enormously in composition Also contamination of the gel with exudate can turn a harmless product into a purgative It is therefore imperative that products of welldefined composition are used for clinical trials that the identity of the plant is confirmed by a taxonomist and that a specimen is deposited in a herbarium for future referencebr
